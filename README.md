# Tic Tac Toe (Javascript)
This project implements advanced javascript concepts like ``factory functions``, ``modules``, ``IIFE``, ``JS OOP`` and BDD using ``Jasmine`` to build a simple [Tic Tac Toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) game played on the browser.

This project was completed in line with standards provided by [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/ "The Global School for Remote Software Developers!").

## Game Rule

Tic Tac Toe is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, using X and O marks.

Players take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid.

The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a

horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
